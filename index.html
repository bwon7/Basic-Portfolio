            <p>I am a student in Georgia Institue of Technology. My major is Chemical Engineering. I have a dog, Latté. He is Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. He was born January. He has many talent. He can eat faster than me. Also, he can give his hand, and follow my order when I have treat for him. He like waking and follow people except me. He also like to sleep on my bed.</p> 
            
            <p>When he came home first time, he is quiet little cute puppy. However, a few days later, he is turning in to troublemaker. He ate all thing on the floor, and chew the wires. But still he is my cuttest puppy ever. He has one thing to scare which is vaccum cleaner. When I start to turn that on, he hide to shose shelf.</p>
